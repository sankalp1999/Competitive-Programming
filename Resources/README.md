**This is my personal space to keep track of stuff other than Notion. Currently, not doing CP that much maintaining to-dos**
** Refer below reflections section for cool stuff. **


## Some reflections on problem solving
- Concentrate on the thinking process. Don't change approaches abruptly. Think a bit longer what else is missing or what can be added.
- **Try figuring out the algorithm/writing it and then implementing when fully sure. Try to get AC with minimum number of submissions.**
- Spend more time on thinking and try to reach the solution without referring to solution quickly.
- Don't get disheartened by failures/off by one errors but make sure that you spend enough time on some approach you did.

Note for me: **Record important links/stuff if you found them useful atleast once. Don't explore to store stuff. That is hoarding.**
Approach: 

Active learning approach with emphasis more on practicing problems and learning concepts on the go.
Not to hoard and search for resources or procrastinate by reading stuff and be pragmatic. I would not write much about 
philosphies here.

Google is your best friend here. But still, I will keep some sites here. CP algorithms, codeforces blogs and codechef, hackerearth have almost everything.

- Grateful to 6.006 and 6.046, 6.042j for helping in basic concepts. This anwer by [Mohd Harris](https://qr.ae/pNsisr) had helped a lot.
- A2OJ ladders and Mustafas sheet
- [Art of problem solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) Not for CP but good website for combinatorics(helped in college course) 


## Platform names
- My favourite and most recommended by top CP'ers like Errichto- Codeforces, Codechef, Atcoder
- Topcoder(UI sucks), HackerRank, HackerEarth(difficulty labelling sucks)
- CSAcademy dead now.
- SPOJ - does not hold contests
- Problemsets: A2OJ, CSES, CF gyms and problemset, progvar.fun

### Tackling some misconceptions
   
  **You don't need to do Competitive programming to clear coding rounds/interviews** but those who are good at CP or even have some experience find it easier
  to prepare for coding interviews. Basically, for coding interviews, you practice those questions that are more relevant there.... Google, Microsoft only care     about you clearing their [interview](https://qr.ae/pNssEu). Chech Ashish Gupta's opinion's on [this](https://qr.ae/pRF9xY)
  
  **Just [start](https://youtu.be/y7169jEvb-Y?t=42) solving problems!!** Learn required DS and algo on the go. Mostly, it's about raw thinking in the initial stage. You will find a lot of problems      where you don't need to know any algorithm or specific data structure. Occasionally exploring resources is fine but don't go in the search of 
   the perfect all in one resource. (I used to do this quite a few times). I believe it is a subtle form of procrastination.
  
### Approach to CP in a nutshell  
   For CP, practice questions on Codeforces and Codechef. HackerRank problem solving section is good for starting.
  (I don't want to make this a CP blog so I won't write much here about resources. You will find on them on your own.)
  - Take Part in contests.
  
  - Focus more on practicing problems on Codeforces and upsolving. If your rating is x, then solve problems [ x, x + 200 ]. Only deliberate practice
    can make you better. 
  
  - Do not learn all the algo and ds stuff first. Things don't work like that. You learn on the go by practicing and studying what is required.
    This is called the project based learning approach sometimes in Dev world or Minimum viable knowledge. 
    Learning in Breadth first search way more and dfs sometimes is helpful in programming and CS.
    
  - There are a lot of resources about guidance on Quora and Codeforces (Google baba is there).You can check them out. Competitive programming is different from 
    normal data structures and algorithms that you implement in lab. You need to know these concepts but you **get good at CP by doing CP**. 
    
    Check out the concept of deliberate practice. In [general](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory#:~:text=Deliberate%20practice%20refers%20to%20a,specific%20goal%20of%20improving%20performance.) and CP related [Here](https://www.redgreencode.com/deliberate-practice-for-software-developers/) You can get **good at CP only by deliberate practice**.

    
    You need to be consistent and know the fact that it is going to be ridiculously hard (if you want to be good like Expert, Master on CF, 5 star on Codechef etc.). At the time of writing this, I am myself not good at CP. 
    But it's fun and one of the best ways to build problem solving, thinking, programming and debugging skills. (There are many other benefits). You
    also become a fast learner in the process.
