## Top Youtube Channels for Competitive Programming and Coding Interview preparation

I had written this long post somewhere else but this is a better place.
All the good YouTube channels for Competitive Programming(not coding interview) I know are-

The handles are the creator's Codeforces user handles.

[Errichto's channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBr_Fu6q9iHYQCh13jmpbrg) by [user:Errichto,2020-04-22]. Tutorials, lectures, advice and contest streams.
One of the best currently.

[Second Thread](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXbCohpE9IoVQUD2Ifg1d1g) by David Heinermer(pardon spelling) As of sep2020, this channel has become really good
. The host is a red coder on CF. He explains solutions to almost all the div2 and div2 contests he participates in and makes videos on Med-Advanced 
CP related topics. Really good quality videos.
