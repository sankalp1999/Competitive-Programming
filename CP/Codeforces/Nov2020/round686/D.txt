We cannot have more numbers
than the max occuring exponent.
What we can do is place the exponent.
Then place the second most occuring exponent 
from the right end.

This way, each later number will be divisible 
by previous numbers since they all have atleast 
one factor in common.

2 2 2 2 2 2 
    3 3 3 3 
        5 5
          7
Ascending order is not required so all we need 
is to place the most occuring once.

then keep multiplying from end etc.
